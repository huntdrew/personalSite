        <h2>Hello.</h2>

          <h3>Coding and Database Management</h3>
          <p>In my free time I enjoy learning how to improve my coding abilities. In the past, I have worked with several different languages through my college
             courses such as Java, Python, C, C++, C#, Assembly Language, Javascript, and CSS. I am currently taking courses on programming and full stack web
             development through Udemy. With this course, I aspire to learn the fundamentals of Full Stack Web Development and acuqire up to 16 projects that I can add
             to a coding portfolio (such as this website). I also have experience working with databases and organizing data using SQL Server and SQL Developer Tools.
             I have also done several assignments that involve REST services and .NET Entity Frameworks. I have been able to create a starter webpage that includes
             HTTPPost, Put, Get, and Delete and I have linked that webpage with a Database created in SQL Developer. The website was a Blazor site created through
             Visual Studio.</p>
